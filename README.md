Dynamic Menu Toggle with Session Persistence is a JavaScript-based solution for managing expandable submenus in navigation menus, ensuring a smooth user experience. The script is designed to work with WordPress dynamic menus and keeps submenu states even after page reloads using sessionStorage.

✨ Features:
✅ Toggle Submenus on Click – Clicking a menu item opens its submenu, clicking again closes it.
✅ Auto Close Other Submenus – When a new parent menu is clicked, the previously open submenu closes.
✅ Remember Open Submenus – Uses sessionStorage to keep submenus open even after a page reload.
✅ Highlight Active Link – Adds a "clicked-link" class to the clicked menu item for better UI.
✅ Reset on Specific Pages – Clears session data when visiting Home (.home) or a specific page (.contact).
✅ Works with Dynamic Menus – No need for manual submenu IDs; the script assigns them automatically.
✅ WordPress Compatible – Works seamlessly with WordPress-generated navigation menus.
